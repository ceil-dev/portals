## Overview

The Portals Library is engineered to enable seamless communication and interaction across various platforms and environments. It serves as a connective layer, allowing developers to integrate these platforms using a chosen transport technology (aka "Ether").

By importing the library, developers can instantly expose chosen data and methods, facilitating interaction between environments â€“ whether directly or through the Portals App or a custom implementation of Portals UI.
